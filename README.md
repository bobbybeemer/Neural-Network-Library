# Neural-Network-Library

I am creating my own neural network library using only Python and numpy. I'm hoping this will help me better understand the math behind neural networks. I've built a class for a general DenseLayer, classes for Activation functions (sigmoid and tanh), and an ErrorFunctions.py file that calculates the mean squared error and its derivative. In the future, I plan to add more features such as dropout layers, convolutional layers, and different error functions (and their derivatives).
